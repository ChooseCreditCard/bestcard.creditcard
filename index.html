          those rankings are always relative – and how to focus on what might actually be best

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do “Best Card” Claims Really Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        When a site calls something “the best credit card”, it usually means “best according to this
        site’s scoring model, assumptions and commercial relationships”. That can still be useful,
        but it is never a universal truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some rankings overweight sign-up bonuses, others prioritise cashback, others focus on travel
        perks. Some only list cards from issuers that pay affiliate commissions, which means other
        solid options may not appear at all. Understanding this context is key before treating any
        best-card list as a definitive answer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Factors -->
    <section id="factors" class="section">
      <h2>What “Best” Actually Depends On</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, the “best” card is usually the one that fits your real life with the fewest
        unpleasant surprises. A few factors matter a lot more than marketing slogans:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Your spending pattern:</strong> Domestic vs. foreign, travel vs. everyday, big
          fixed bills vs. many small transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your tolerance for fees:</strong> Are you okay with an annual fee if total value
          is higher, or do you prefer strictly no-fee cards?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How you handle balances:</strong> If you sometimes carry a balance, interest rate
          and cost of borrowing may matter more than rewards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your travel intensity:</strong> Lounges and premium insurance can be great – but
          only if you actually travel often enough to use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your credit profile:</strong> Some “top” cards are hard to qualify for. A slightly
          less glamorous card you can reliably get and keep may be a better fit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Educational hubs like Choose.Creditcard aim to break these factors down so you can decide
        what “best” means for you before looking at specific offers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lists -->
    <section id="lists" class="section">
      <h2>How to Read “Best Card” Lists More Critically</h2>
      <p>
        You do not have to ignore rankings completely. Instead, you can treat them as structured
        starting points – if you understand how they are built.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Look for methodology:</strong> Good lists explain their scoring system and what
          they optimise for: travel, cashback, low interest, technology, or a mix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check for affiliate relationships:</strong> If a site earns commissions, that
          should be disclosed clearly. Commission does not automatically mean bias, but it is
          important context.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Match filters to your profile:</strong> A “best travel card” list is only
          relevant if you actually travel in a similar way to the target user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify key details:</strong> Use rankings to build a short-list, then verify
          fees, protections and conditions directly in issuer documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid one-size-fits-all claims:</strong> Any article promising the single “best
          card for everyone” is oversimplifying by design.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, transparent comparison hubs can earn trust by showing their logic clearly and
        updating data regularly instead of chasing only eye-catching headlines.
